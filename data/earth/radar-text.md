# Earth Observation Narrative

# Section

This view is optimized for teams building practical Earth observation products in the next 12 to 18 months.

## What this mode emphasizes

- Reliable geospatial delivery over experimental complexity
- Standards-first interoperability across cloud systems
- Production-ready analytics and QA workflows

## Planning guidance

Start with **Adopt** technologies for new production work, use **Trial** for bounded pilots, and treat **Assess** as strategic exploration. Keep **Hold** items only when legacy constraints make them unavoidable.
