# Space Observation Narrative

# Section

This view focuses on technologies for satellite systems, orbital operations, and downstream Earth observation products.

## What this mode emphasizes

- Scalable mission operations and repeatable constellation workflows
- Sensor fusion and onboard processing for faster insight latency
- Open standards that keep ground systems interoperable

## Planning guidance

Prioritize **Adopt** entries for production programs and operational tooling. Use **Trial** for mission-bounded pilots. Keep **Assess** exploratory and time-boxed, and restrict **Hold** to legacy integrations with explicit retirement plans.
